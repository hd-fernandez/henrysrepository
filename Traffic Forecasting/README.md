Traffic forecasting for Time Series final project

Please have a look at the powerpoint to view our work as it relates to Predictingtraffic patterns in 4 major city junctions across multi-month forecasts.
We use a variety of forecasting techniques for a tricky dataset and find some interesting insights.

Data Assumptions/Hypotheses: 
All vehicle types are collected the same
These major junctions will mimic other major city junctions as well
Four months is a sufficient amount of data/time to model daily traffic

Model Assumptions/Hypotheses: 
sMAPE and MASE will be the best model grading criteria
The Forecasting Competition ranking will serve as our model ranking
